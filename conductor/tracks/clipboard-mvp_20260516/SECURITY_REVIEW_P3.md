# Phase 3 Security Review: Clipboard Monitoring & Capture

**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Track:** clipboard-mvp_20260516
**Phase:** 3 — Clipboard Monitoring & Capture
**Build:** Debug (xcodebuild succeeded)
**Codesign:** Valid on disk, satisfies Designated Requirement

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 introduces the core functionality of reading from the system pasteboard (`NSPasteboard`). The primary security considerations for this phase revolve around safely handling arbitrary, untrusted data from the user's clipboard and ensuring that large or malicious payloads do not compromise the application. The review confirms that the `ContentTypeDetector` uses safe heuristics, `ClipboardCaptureService` properly truncates and secures content, and the memory footprint is managed appropriately. Overall security posture: SOLID.

## Checklist Results

| # | Item | Verdict | Summary |
|---|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Sandbox Compliance | ✅ PASS | Carried over; no new entitlements required for `NSPasteboard` access |
| 2 | Data at Rest | ✅ PASS | Captured entries are successfully piped into the Phase 2 encrypted repository |
| 3 | Memory Hygiene | ✅ PASS | `ClipboardCaptureService` generates thumbnails for images and immediately releases full `NSImage` buffers |
| 4 | Input Validation | ✅ PASS | `ContentTypeDetector` uses string heuristics safely without evaluating or rendering untrusted content |
| 5 | Keychain Hygiene | ✅ PASS | Carried over from Phase 2 |
| 6 | Network Surface | ✅ PASS | Carried over; zero network access |
| 7 | Third-Party Audit | ✅ PASS | Uses first-party AppKit APIs exclusively |
| 8 | Content Filtering | ⬜ DEFERRED | No content filtering implemented (spec defers to Track 3) |

## 1. Sandbox Compliance — ✅ PASS (Carried over)

Entitlements remain unchanged. `NSPasteboard.general` access does not require additional sandbox entitlements in macOS 14.

## 2. Data at Rest — ✅ PASS (Carried over)

The `ClipboardCaptureService` correctly instantiates `ClipboardEntry` instances and passes them directly to `ClipboardRepository.save()`, ensuring all payload data is encrypted at rest using AES-GCM before database insertion.

## 3. Memory Hygiene — ✅ PASS

### Evidence
- `ClipboardCaptureService` uses `generateThumbnail(from:maxDimension:)` to downsample images to 48x48.
- Large text payloads are processed as standard Swift `String` and `Data` objects, relying on Swift's ARC for automatic deallocation when the `captureCurrentPasteboard` task concludes.

### Analysis
By downsampling images to thumbnails and discarding the full-resolution `NSImage` immediately after capture, the app prevents memory exhaustion attacks where a user copies massive image data to the clipboard. The actor-based concurrency model ensures safe execution off the main thread.

## 4. Input Validation — ✅ PASS

### Evidence
- `ContentTypeDetector` relies on basic substring matching (`.contains`) and `hasPrefix` checks to infer "markdown" and "code" formats.
- It never invokes `eval()`, `NSTextView` rendering, or any WebKit components to parse or "execute" the clipboard contents.

### Analysis
All clipboard data is treated purely as inert text or byte arrays. Because the data is never executed or rendered during the capture phase, injection risks (like XSS or script injection) are mitigated at this layer. Future UI rendering (Phase 4) must maintain this safety boundary.

## 5. Keychain Hygiene — ✅ PASS (Carried over)

No changes to `KeychainManager`.

## 6. Network Surface — ✅ PASS (Carried over)

No new network code introduced.

## 7. Third-Party Audit — ✅ PASS

No new third-party dependencies introduced. The `AsyncStream` and `NSPasteboard` implementations rely entirely on the Swift Standard Library and Apple's AppKit.

## 8. Content Filtering — ⬜ DEFERRED

Deferred to Track 3 implementation.

## Build Verification

- **xcodebuild**: BUILD SUCCEEDED
- **Tests**: All tests passed for `ClipboardCaptureService`, `ContentTypeDetector`, and `PasteboardMonitor`.
- **Build path**: `DerivedData/ClipVault...`
